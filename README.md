# WorldGuardCustomFlag

WGCustomFlags plugin that denies interaction with some blocks

## Flags
* `anvil-damage` cancels damage to anvils
* `open-door` cancels the opening of doors, traps and gates

This project was inspired by the work on [ArmorStand-Limiter](https://github.com/xSavior-of-God/ArmorStand-Limiter) who allows you to limit armor stands.
